# BeautyInMath

Welcome to BeautyInMath, where mathematics meets artistry through mesmerizing visualizations of various mathematical patterns and algorithms.

## Overview

BeautyInMath is an application built using Python and Pygame to create stunning visualizations of mathematical patterns. The current version includes:

- Epicycloid
- Koch Snowflake (moveable and zoomable)
- Brownian Snowflake

These visualizations are not only aesthetically pleasing but also serve as educational tools to explore the beauty of mathematical concepts.

## Features

- **Koch Snowflake:**
  - Moveable and zoomable for interactive exploration.
- **Brownian Snowflake:**
  - Demonstrates random movement and fractal formation.
- **Epicycloid:**
  - Illustrates the path traced by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling around another circle.
- **User-Friendly Frontend:**
  - Allows users to change parameters and watch the patterns they like.
  - Ability to turn off other patterns for focused viewing.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad1Omer/BeautyInMath.git
   cd BeautyInMath

   
### 2. Install dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. Then install the required packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    pip install numpy
    pip install time
    pip install cx_Freeze
    pip install pyshortcuts

### 3. Run the application

To create a shortcut for easy access to the application, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python create_shortcut.py
    
This script will create a shortcut named BeautyInMath on your desktop, allowing you to launch the application conveniently.

## Future Enhancements

I am currently learning Models in Django. Once proficient, I plan to launch the app with user-friendly parameter control for an enhanced user experience.

Stay tuned for more updates and features as I continue to develop BeautyInMath!

## Contribution

Feel free to share your ideas and make changes, and submit pull requests. Contributions are welcomed!!!
